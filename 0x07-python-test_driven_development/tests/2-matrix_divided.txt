The `matrix_divided` Function
======================

Prototype:
    def matrix_divided(matrix, div)

Description:
    The `matrix_divided` function divides all elements of a matrix by a given number (`div`). The matrix is represented as a list of lists, where each inner list represents a row of the matrix. The elements of the matrix must be integers or floats. If the matrix or `div` does not meet the specified requirements, appropriate exceptions are raised: TypeError for invalid matrix format or `div` type, and ZeroDivisionError for division by zero. The resulting matrix is rounded to 2 decimal places.

Tests
-------------------

Checking division of a valid matrix:
    >>> matrix = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]]
    >>> div = 2
    >>> matrix_divided(matrix, div)
    [[0.5, 1.0, 1.5], [2.0, 2.5, 3.0], [3.5, 4.0, 4.5]]

Checking division of a matrix with float elements:
    >>> matrix = [[1.5, 2.5], [3.5, 4.5]]
    >>> div = 0.5
    >>> matrix_dividedr

Checking division by zero:
    >>> matrix = [[1, 2], [3, 4]]
    >>> div = 0
    >>> matrix_divided(matrix, div)
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    ZeroDivisionError: division by zero

(matrix, div)
    [[3.0, 5.0], [7.0, 9.0]]

Checking division of a matrix with negative elements:
    >>> matrix = [[-1, -2], [-3, -4]]
    >>> div = -1
    >>> matrix_divided(matrix, div)
    [[1.0, 2.0], [3.0, 4.0]]

Checking division of an empty matrix:
    >>> matrix = []
    >>> div = 2
    >>> matrix_divided(matrix, div)
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    TypeError: matrix must be a matrix (list of lists) of integers/floats

Checking division of a matrix with rows of different sizes:
    >>> matrix = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5], [6, 7, 8]]
    >>> div = 2
    >>> matrix_divided(matrix, div)
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    TypeError: Each row of the matrix must have the same size

Checking division with an invalid type for `div`:
    >>> matrix = [[1, 2], [3, 4]]
    >>> div = "2"
    >>> matrix_divided(matrix, div)
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    TypeError: div must be a number
