The `say_my_name` Function
======================

Prototype:
    def say_my_name(first_name, last_name="")

Description:
    The `say_my_name` function prints a message with the given first name and last name. If a last name is not provided, the function will only use the first name. Both `first_name` and `last_name` must be strings. If any of the arguments are not of the expected type, a TypeError exception is raised.
