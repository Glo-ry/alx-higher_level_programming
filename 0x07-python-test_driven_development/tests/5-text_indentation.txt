The `text_indentation` Function
======================

Prototype:
    def text_indentation(text)

Description:
    The `text_indentation` function prints the provided text with two new lines after each occurrence of the characters '.', '?' and ':'. The `text` parameter must be a string. If the argument is not of the expected type, a TypeError exception is raised. The printed lines should not have any spaces at the beginning or end.
